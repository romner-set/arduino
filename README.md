Code for autorotating a monitor using an arduino's accelerometer in [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org), and also some BLE stuff because why not?

This is so niche that I'm pretty sure nobody except me will find this useful, but feel free to message me if you want to get this working.

I also made a windows version as a part of [this mess](https://github.com/romner-set/everythingdoer) if that's more your jam
